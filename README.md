# WebStart
##Starter Web DSP Project

###Overview
A sample web application starter project consisting of main container page (BOOTMAIN) and components for login (BOOTLOGIN), alerts (BOOTALERT), simple navigation (BOOTNAV) and a sample page (BOOTPAGE). More features will be added for upcoming lectures.

####Background
It was built for the Uniface Lecture Webinar: Building Responsive Applications, and aims to provide a starting point for application architecture. It provides a simpler implementation than the WebFramework project, which contains some features you may not require (e.g. routing tables & html 5 history, which adds more Javascript dependencies and could introduce security risks). This project does add some additional features, however:
- login persistence via isolated storage or cookies
- separate alert component to allow more flexible positioning (e.g. after navigation). 

####Dependencies
Various UI resources are used:
- bootstrap
- jquery
- font-awesome

###Installation and Configuration
To be tested and documented - use the DevelopmentTools installer.
